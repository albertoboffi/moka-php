## 🌟 Why Moka?

Traditional PHP API development often requires extensive boilerplate for control flow management. Moka PHP eliminates this overhead by abstracting low-level operations such as header management, request parsing, error handling, response structuring, security and other essential API infrastructure services. This streamlined approach ensures a cleaner architecture, enabling you to focus on feature delivery rather than infrastructure plumbing.
